This is a simple Java project that displays a message through a Docker container. It is configured to listen on port 8080.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine.

## Steps to test the program

### 1. Clone the repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine.

```

### 2. Build the Docker image
In the directory where the Dockerfile is located, run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t hola-mundo-java .
```

### 3. Run the Docker container
